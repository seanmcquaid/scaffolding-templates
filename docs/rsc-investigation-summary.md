# React Server Components (RSC) Support Investigation

## Overview

This document summarizes the investigation into React Server Components (RSC) support in React Router v7 across our scaffolding templates.

## Key Findings

### ‚ùå RSC Not Yet Supported
React Router v7.7.0 does not include native React Server Components support. While React 19 provides the underlying RSC APIs, React Router has not yet implemented the framework-level integration needed for full RSC functionality.

### ‚úÖ Excellent SSR Alternative
React Router v7 provides robust server-side rendering with:
- Streaming SSR with `renderToPipeableStream`
- Server-side data loading via loaders
- React 19 concurrent features
- Performance optimizations

## What We've Done

### 1. Template Updates
- **react-router-v7-ssr**: Updated to React Router 7.7.0, added RSC investigation docs
- **react-router-v7-rsc**: New experimental template exploring RSC patterns

### 2. Documentation
- Comprehensive RSC investigation results
- Future migration strategies
- Current workaround patterns
- Roadmap for RSC integration

### 3. Experimental Implementation
- Example RSC component patterns
- Configuration placeholders for future RSC support
- Educational demonstrations of RSC concepts

## Template Status

| Template | RSC Support | Status | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|--------|---------|
| `react-router-v7-ssr` | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Production Ready | Current SSR best practices |
| `react-router-v7-rsc` | üî¨ | ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental | RSC pattern exploration |
| `react-router-v7-spa` | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Production Ready | Client-side rendering |

## Current Workarounds

While waiting for native RSC support, developers can achieve similar benefits using:

### Server-Side Data Loading
```typescript
// Using React Router loaders for server data
export async function loader() {
  const data = await fetchFromDatabase();
  return json(data);
}
```

### Server Middleware
```typescript
// Server-side logic in middleware
export const middleware: Route.MiddlewareFunction = async (
  { request },
  next
) => {
  const serverData = await processOnServer();
  return next();
};
```

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 1: Current (‚úÖ Complete)
- Investigation of React Router v7 RSC capabilities
- Documentation of current limitations
- Experimental template creation
- Migration strategy development

### Phase 2: Monitoring (üîÑ Ongoing)
- Track React Router roadmap for RSC announcements
- Community engagement on RSC patterns
- Template maintenance and updates

### Phase 3: Integration (‚è≥ Future)
- Implement native RSC support when available
- Migration guides for existing projects
- Template updates with RSC best practices

## Recommendations

### For New Projects
1. **Use `react-router-v7-ssr`** for production applications
2. **Leverage loaders** for server-side data needs
3. **Structure components** with future RSC migration in mind

### For Learning RSC
1. **Explore `react-router-v7-rsc`** template for RSC concepts
2. **Review documentation** in `docs/rsc-support.md`
3. **Experiment with patterns** in preparation for future support

### For Framework Maintainers
1. **Monitor React Router** development for RSC integration plans
2. **Contribute to community** discussions on RSC patterns
3. **Prepare migration tools** for when RSC support arrives
