4. **react-router-v7-ssr**: Server-side rendered application using React Router v7
5. **tanstack-router-spa**: Single-page application using TanStack Router

## Coding Standards & Patterns

### Package Management
- Use **pnpm** as the package manager throughout all project templates
- Maintain consistent Node.js version (>=22.12.0) across projects
- Use workspace configuration for managing multiple project templates

### Code Quality Tools
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Code linting and formatting with comprehensive rule sets
- **TypeScript**: All project templates use TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Husky**: Git hooks for pre-commit validation
- **lint-staged**: Run linters on staged files only

### Testing Strategy
- **Vitest**: Primary testing framework for unit/integration tests
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing for frontend applications
- **@testing-library/react**: Component testing utilities
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: API mocking for testing

### Build & Development
- **Vite**: Primary build tool for most project templates
- **tsup**: Build tool for TypeScript libraries
- **Turbopack**: Used with Next.js for fast development

### Common Architectural Patterns

#### File Organization
Follow consistent directory structure across project templates:
- `/src` or `/app`: Main application source code
- `/components`: Reusable UI components (ui/ and app/ subdirectories)
- `/hooks`: Custom React hooks
- `/services`: API client and data fetching logic
- `/types`: TypeScript type definitions
- `/utils`: Utility functions
- `/constants`: Application constants and enums
- `/docs`: Project-specific documentation

##### File Organization Best Practices
- **Keep related files close**: Co-locate tests, types, and components in the same directory when they're tightly coupled
- **Separate concerns clearly**: Don't mix UI components with business logic components
- **Follow naming conventions**: Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- **Avoid deep nesting**: Keep directory structures shallow (max 3-4 levels deep)
- **Feature-based organization**: Group files by feature rather than by file type when features grow large

#### Component Patterns
- Separate UI components (presentational) from app components (feature-specific)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states

##### Component Development Best Practices
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component should have one clear purpose
- **Composition over inheritance**: Use component composition patterns rather than complex inheritance
- **Props interface design**: Keep props interfaces simple and focused; avoid "god objects"
- **Error boundaries**: Implement error boundaries at appropriate levels (page, feature, or critical component level)
- **Loading states**: Always handle loading, error, and empty states explicitly
- **Accessibility first**: Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes; test with screen readers
- **Performance optimization**: Use React.memo for expensive components, useMemo for expensive calculations

#### State Management
- **TanStack Query**: For server state management
- **React Hook Form**: For form state management
- Local component state with useState/useReducer for UI state

##### State Management Best Practices
- **Keep state local**: Only lift state up when multiple components need it
- **Prefer URL state**: Use URL parameters for shareable application state
- **Avoid prop drilling**: Use React Context for deeply nested components (sparingly)
- **Server state vs client state**: Distinguish between server data (use TanStack Query) and client UI state (use local state)
- **Derived state**: Calculate derived values in render rather than storing them in state
- **State normalization**: Normalize complex state structures to avoid deep nesting and mutations

#### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui**: Component library built on Radix UI
- **CSS Modules**: When component-scoped styles are needed

##### Styling Best Practices
- **Design system consistency**: Use consistent spacing, colors, and typography scales across all templates
- **Mobile-first responsive design**: Start with mobile layouts and enhance for larger screens
- **Semantic CSS classes**: When using custom CSS, prefer semantic class names over presentational ones
- **Performance optimization**: Purge unused CSS in production; use CSS-in-JS judiciously
- **Accessibility considerations**: Ensure sufficient color contrast; provide focus indicators
- **Component variants**: Use tools like `class-variance-authority` for systematic component variations

#### Internationalization (i18n)
- **i18next**: Primary i18n solution
- **react-i18next**: React bindings for i18next
- Type-safe translation keys

##### Internationalization Best Practices
- **Type-safe translations**: Generate TypeScript types from translation files to catch missing keys at compile time
- **Namespace organization**: Organize translations by feature or page to avoid conflicts and improve maintainability
- **Pluralization support**: Use i18next's pluralization features for proper plural forms across languages
- **Context-aware translations**: Provide context to translators through key naming and comments
- **Lazy loading**: Load translation bundles on-demand for better performance
- **RTL support**: Consider right-to-left languages in CSS and layout design
