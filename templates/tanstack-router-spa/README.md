## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **git** (version control)
- **nvm** (Node Version Manager)
- **Node.js** >=22.12.0
- **pnpm** (recommended package manager)

> **ℹ️ Note:** The `setup.sh` script will automatically install **git**, **nvm**, and **pnpm** if they are not already available on your system (macOS and Linux supported). You may still install them manually if you prefer.

> **💡 Tip:** Use [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily manage different Node.js versions:
>
> ```bash
> # Install and use Node.js 22
> nvm install 22
> nvm use 22
> ```

### Automated Setup

Run the setup script to automatically configure everything:

```bash
# Make the setup script executable and run it
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

This script will:

- Install pnpm if not already available
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for environment configuration
- Validate environment variables and warn about example values
- Install all dependencies
- Install Playwright browsers for testing
- Initialize MSW service worker for API mocking

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Install Playwright browsers
pnpm exec playwright install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

## 🌍 Internationalization

This template enforces **mandatory internationalization** with type-safe translation keys:

### Using Translations

```tsx
import useAppTranslation from '@/hooks/useAppTranslation';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { t } = useAppTranslation();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t('HomePage.title')}</h1>
      <p>{t('HomePage.description')}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Adding Translations

1. Add translation keys to `src/i18n/locales/en-US.ts`
2. TypeScript will enforce type safety for all translation keys
3. ESLint prevents hardcoded strings in components

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

The template implements a **3-tier testing approach**:

### 1. Unit Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests for components, hooks, utilities
pnpm test
```

### 2. Integration Tests

```bash
# Test component interactions with mocked APIs using Playwright
pnpm playwright:run-integration
```

### 3. End-to-End Tests

```bash
# Test complete user flows with Playwright
pnpm playwright:run-e2e
```

### Lighthouse Integration

- Performance testing with Lighthouse
- Automated accessibility and performance audits
- Integration with Playwright for CI/CD pipelines

## 📊 State Management

The template follows a **hierarchical state management approach**:

- **URL State** - For shareable application state (search, filters)
- **Local Storage** - For user preferences (theme, settings)
- **Component State** - For UI state (modals, forms)
- **TanStack Query** - For server state management
- **React Hook Form** - For form state and validation

## 🎨 Styling & Components

- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui** - High-quality, accessible components
- **CVA** - Component variant management
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Adding New Routes

1. Create route files in `src/routes/` following TanStack Router conventions
2. Routes are automatically generated based on file structure
3. Leverage type-safe route parameters and search params
4. Add navigation and translations as needed

Example route structure:

```
src/routes/
├── __root.tsx          # Root layout
├── index.tsx           # Home page (/)
├── about.tsx           # About page (/about)
└── posts/
    ├── index.tsx       # Posts list (/posts)
    └── $id.tsx         # Individual post (/posts/$id)
```

### Creating Components

1. **UI Components** - Place in `src/components/ui/`
2. **Feature Components** - Place in `src/components/app/`
3. Write tests alongside components
4. Use `useAppTranslation` for all user-facing text

### Route-Level Features

1. **Type-Safe Parameters** - Automatic TypeScript inference for route params
2. **Search Params** - Type-safe search parameter handling
3. **Route Guards** - Authentication and authorization at route level
4. **Loaders & Actions** - Data fetching patterns with TanStack Query

### API Integration

1. Define types in `src/types/`
2. Create API clients in `src/services/`
3. Use TanStack Query for data fetching
4. Mock APIs with MSW for testing

## 🚀 Production Build

```bash
# Build the application
pnpm build

# Preview the build locally
pnpm serve
```

The build is optimized for:

- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Bundle size optimization with analysis
- Modern JavaScript features
- Static asset optimization
- Lighthouse performance targets
