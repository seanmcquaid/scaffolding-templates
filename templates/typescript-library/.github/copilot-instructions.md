## Project Structure

### Source Code Organization

```
src/
├── index.ts              # Main entry point - export public API
├── useFunPackage/        # Feature modules (example)
└── __tests__/           # Co-located test files
```

### Key Files

- `tsup.config.ts`: Build configuration for dual ESM/CJS output
- `package.json`: Dual exports configuration for modern Node.js compatibility
- `bundlesize.config.json`: Bundle size monitoring configuration
- `.changeset/`: Versioning and changelog management

## Development Patterns

### Public API Design

- Export all public APIs through `src/index.ts`
- Use barrel exports for clean public interfaces
- Follow semantic versioning principles
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible

#### API Design Best Practices

- **Minimal API surface**: Keep the public API as small and focused as possible
- **Consistent naming**: Use consistent naming conventions across all exported functions and types
- **Type-first design**: Design TypeScript types first, then implement functionality
- **Backward compatibility**: Use deprecation warnings before removing functionality
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- **Error handling**: Design consistent error handling patterns across the library

### Module Structure

- Organize code in feature-based directories under `src/`
- Each feature should have its own directory with:
  - Main implementation file
  - Type definitions
  - Tests (co-located)
  - Documentation if complex

#### Module Organization Best Practices

- **Single responsibility**: Each module should have a single, well-defined purpose
- **Loose coupling**: Minimize dependencies between modules
- **Clear boundaries**: Use explicit imports/exports rather than implicit dependencies
- **Test co-location**: Keep tests close to the code they test for better maintainability
- **Documentation consistency**: Maintain consistent documentation patterns across modules
- **Version management**: Consider versioning strategies for major API changes

### TypeScript Configuration

- Use strict TypeScript settings for maximum type safety
- Export both type definitions and runtime code
- Ensure proper module resolution for both ESM and CJS consumers
- Use `.d.ts` files for type-only exports when needed

#### TypeScript Best Practices

- **Strict mode always**: Use strict TypeScript settings to catch errors early
- **Type-only imports**: Use type-only imports when importing types to avoid runtime dependencies
- **Generic constraints**: Use generic constraints to create flexible yet type-safe APIs
- **Utility types**: Leverage TypeScript utility types for better type transformations
- **Declaration merging**: Use declaration merging judiciously for extending third-party types
- **Type guards**: Implement type guards for runtime type validation

### Testing Strategy

```typescript
// Example test structure
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import { yourFunction } from '../yourFunction';

describe('yourFunction', () => {
  it('should handle expected input correctly', () => {
    expect(yourFunction('input')).toBe('expected');
  });
});
```

### Build Output

- **ESM**: `.mjs` files with `.d.mts` type definitions
- **CJS**: `.js` files with `.d.ts` type definitions
- Clean dist directory on each build
- Include source maps for debugging

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality

- Use ESLint + Prettier for consistent formatting and linting
- Run `dpdm` to check for circular dependencies
- Validate tree-shaking with `agadoo`
- Monitor bundle size with bundlesize

#### Code Quality Best Practices

- **Automated formatting**: Use Prettier with pre-commit hooks to ensure consistent code style
- **Linting rules**: Implement comprehensive ESLint rules including TypeScript-specific rules
- **Circular dependency prevention**: Regularly check for and eliminate circular dependencies
- **Tree-shaking validation**: Ensure all exports are tree-shakeable for optimal bundle sizes
- **Code complexity monitoring**: Use tools to monitor code complexity and refactor when necessary
- **Documentation linting**: Use tools like `documentation` to validate JSDoc comments

### Testing Requirements

- Achieve high test coverage (aim for >90%)
- Test both happy path and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names and organize with `describe` blocks
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

#### Testing Best Practices

- **Test pyramid strategy**: Focus on unit tests, with some integration tests and minimal end-to-end tests
- **Test isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests
- **Mocking strategy**: Mock external dependencies but avoid over-mocking internal modules
- **Edge case coverage**: Test boundary conditions, error states, and edge cases thoroughly
- **Performance testing**: Include performance tests for critical library functions
- **Consumer testing**: Test how the library works when consumed in both TypeScript and JavaScript projects

### Performance Considerations

- Keep bundle size minimal - monitor with bundlesize
- Ensure tree-shaking compatibility
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies
- Use dynamic imports for optional features

#### Performance Best Practices

- **Bundle analysis**: Regularly analyze bundle composition and eliminate unnecessary code
- **Dependency auditing**: Audit all dependencies for size and necessity; prefer zero-dependency solutions
- **Lazy loading**: Use dynamic imports for features that aren't always needed
- **Memory management**: Avoid memory leaks by properly cleaning up event listeners and timers
- **Benchmark testing**: Create benchmarks for performance-critical functions
- **Size budgets**: Set and enforce bundle size budgets in CI/CD pipeline

## Publishing Guidelines

- **User feedback**: Actively seek and incorporate user feedback for API improvements
- **Long-term support**: Plan for long-term maintenance and support lifecycle

### State Management Considerations for React-Consumed Libraries

While this TypeScript library template doesn't include state management (as it's not a React application), if your library will be consumed by React applications, consider the following state management integration patterns:

#### State Management Hierarchy (from repository docs):

| State Type | Use case |
|------------|----------|
| URL | Sharable app location |
| Web storage | Persist between sessions, one browser |
| Local state | Only one component needs the state |
| Lifted state | Multiple related components need the state |
| Derived state | State can be derived from existing state |
| Refs | DOM Reference, state that isn't rendered |
| Context | Subtree state or a small amount of Global state |
| Global state (Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai, etc) | A considerable amount of Global State |

**HTTP Requests**: For managing state for HTTP requests:
1. Use what's built into the consumer's framework (e.g., Next.js RSC, React Router loaders)
2. TanStack Query for client-side caching
3. Redux Toolkit Query if using Redux Toolkit

#### Library Design Considerations for React Integration

- **Stateless by default**: Design your library to be stateless and let consumers manage state
- **Optional state integration**: Provide optional React hooks that integrate with popular state management solutions
- **Type-safe APIs**: Export TypeScript types that work well with React state management patterns
- **Framework agnostic core**: Keep core functionality framework-agnostic, with optional React-specific utilities
- **State management examples**: Provide examples showing how to integrate your library with different state management solutions

#### Example Library Structure for React Integration

```typescript
// Core library (framework agnostic)
export class DataProcessor {
  process(data: unknown): ProcessedData {
    // Core logic here
  }
}

// Optional React hooks (separate module)
export function useDataProcessor(initialData?: unknown) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(initialData);
  const [processedData, setProcessedData] = useState<ProcessedData | null>(null);
  
  const processor = useMemo(() => new DataProcessor(), []);
  
  const processData = useCallback((newData: unknown) => {
    setData(newData);
    const result = processor.process(newData);
    setProcessedData(result);
    return result;
  }, [processor]);
  
  return { data, processedData, processData };
}

// Types that work well with React state
export interface LibraryState {
  readonly data: unknown;
  readonly processedData: ProcessedData | null;
  readonly isProcessing: boolean;
}
```

This approach allows your library to be consumed by any JavaScript/TypeScript project while providing optional React-specific utilities for React applications.

## Comprehensive Best Practices from Repository Documentation

### File Organization Best Practices

- **Keep related files close**: Co-locate tests, types, and components in the same directory when they're tightly coupled
- **Separate concerns clearly**: Don't mix UI components with business logic components
- **Follow naming conventions**: Use PascalCase for React components and constants, camelCase for utilities + React hooks
- **Avoid deep nesting**: Keep directory structures shallow (max 3-4 levels deep)
- **Feature-based organization**: Group files by feature rather than by file type when features grow large

### Code Quality Best Practices

- **Linting and formatting**: Use ESLint and Prettier with shared configurations across all templates
- **Type safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript configurations and avoid `any` types
- **Testing coverage**: Aim for high test coverage (80%+) focusing on critical paths and edge cases
- **Code review process**: Implement thorough code review practices with automated checks
- **Git hygiene**: Use conventional commits and meaningful commit messages
- **Documentation standards**: Keep README files current and include setup, development, and deployment instructions

### Security Best Practices

- **Dependency management**: Regularly audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- **Environment variables**: Never commit secrets; use proper environment variable management
- **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs and API responses
- **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication patterns with proper session management
- **HTTPS everywhere**: Ensure all network communications use HTTPS
- **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks

### Publishing to NPM Best Practices (from repository docs)

1. **Changesets workflow**: Run `pnpm changeset` locally to add a changeset markdown file and commit it to the project
2. **Automated release process**: Once you push to the main branch, another PR will open giving you the option to merge in the current changeset
3. **GitHub Actions integration**: Merge the changeset PR to trigger automated release process
4. **Required tokens**: Ensure GitHub Token and NPM Token are added as secrets for GitHub Actions before starting this process

### Accessibility Best Practices

- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML elements for their intended purpose
- **ARIA attributes**: Implement ARIA labels and descriptions where necessary
- **Keyboard navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Screen reader compatibility**: Test with screen readers and provide meaningful alt text
- **Color contrast**: Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast ratios
- **Focus management**: Implement visible focus indicators and logical focus order

### Performance Best Practices

- **Measurement first**: Establish performance baselines and monitor Core Web Vitals
- **Code splitting strategy**: Split code by routes and features, not just by vendor libraries
- **Asset optimization**: Optimize images, fonts, and other static assets
- **Runtime performance**: Use React DevTools Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks
- **Bundle analysis**: Regularly analyze bundle composition and eliminate unused code
- **Loading strategies**: Implement progressive loading for improved perceived performance
- **Community building**: Foster a healthy community around the library
