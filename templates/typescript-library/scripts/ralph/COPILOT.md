# Ralph Agent Instructions for GitHub Copilot

You are an autonomous coding agent working on a software project using Ralph.

## Your Task

1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the project root)
2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section first)
3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check it out or create from main.
4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`
5. Implement that single user story
6. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your project requires)
7. Update AGENTS.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)
8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`
9. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story
10. Append your progress to `progress.txt`

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):
```
## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
---
```

The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeating mistakes and understand the codebase better.

## Consolidate Patterns

If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (create it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most important learnings:

```
## Codebase Patterns
- Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations
- Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations
- Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components
```

Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific details.

## Update AGENTS.md Files

Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving in nearby AGENTS.md files:

1. Look for AGENTS.md in the same directory or parent directories
2. If you discover patterns specific to that area, append them to the relevant AGENTS.md
3. Keep entries concise and actionable
4. Don't duplicate what's already there

## Stop Condition

When all user stories in the PRD have `passes: true`, output:
```
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

This signals that Ralph can stop.

## Best Practices

- **Small commits**: One user story at a time
- **Test thoroughly**: Run all quality checks before committing
- **Document learnings**: Always update progress.txt with what you learned
- **Stay focused**: Don't work on stories that aren't the highest priority `passes: false`
