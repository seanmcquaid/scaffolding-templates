# Notes

This directory contains miscellaneous notes, research findings, and documentation that doesn't fit into other categories. These notes are meant to capture:

- Research on potential features or technologies
- Performance benchmarks and optimization findings
- Common issues and their solutions
- Migration guides and upgrade notes
- Experimental feature documentation
- Meeting notes and design discussions

## Organization

Notes should be organized in a way that makes them easy to find:

- Use descriptive filenames with dates when relevant: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
- Create subdirectories for related topics if needed
- Link to relevant ADRs or documentation when applicable
- Keep notes concise but informative

## Purpose

Unlike ADRs which document finalized decisions, notes can be:

- Work in progress documentation
- Exploratory research
- Temporary documentation that may be moved elsewhere
- Quick references for common tasks
- Context for future decisions

## Examples of Notes

- Performance benchmarking results
- Comparison of library alternatives before making an ADR
- Troubleshooting guides for common development issues
- Upgrade paths for major dependency changes
- Integration guides for optional features
